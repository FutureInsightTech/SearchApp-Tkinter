# Text Search Application

A Python-based application that enables users to search through multiple text files using two different algorithms: Brute Force and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP). The application provides features for case sensitivity and whole word matching.

## Features

- **Brute Force Search**: A straightforward approach that checks all possible positions for the search pattern.
- **KMP Search**: A more efficient algorithm that reduces the number of character comparisons.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Option to toggle case sensitivity during searches.
- **Whole Word Match**: Option to find whole words only, ignoring partial matches.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Pandas**: For handling data in tabular form (loading text files into a DataFrame).
- **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for user interaction.
- **Glob**: For file pattern matching.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TextSearchApplication.git
cd TextSearchApplication
```

### Install Required Libraries

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
    pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that your text files are named following the pattern `Research#*.txt` and are in the same directory as the application.
2. Run the application:

```bash
    python Search_App.py
```

3. Enter the search text in the provided input field.
4. Choose the search algorithm (Brute Force or KMP) from the dropdown menu.
5. Optionally, check the "Case Sensitive" and "Whole Word Match" boxes as needed.
6. Click the "Search" button to initiate the search.
7. The results will be displayed in the text area below the button.

## Running the Application

### On Windows

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is located.
3. Run the command:

```bash
    python Search_App.py.py
```

### On Linux

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the application is located.
